Men are all alike.
They're always bugging us about something or other.
Well, my boyfriend made me come here.
He says I'm depressed much of the time.
It's true, I am unhappy.
I need some help; that much seems certain.
Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.
My mother takes care of me.
My father.
You are like my father in some ways.
