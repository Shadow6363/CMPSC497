I'll be serving you tonight.
Is there anything I can get you to drink?
A soda.
Alright, I'll be right back with that.
Here's your soda.
Have you decided what you'd like to eat?
No, could you give me a few minutes?
Alright, I'll give you a few.
How about now?
Yes.
What would you like?
I'll have the pizza.
Sounds good. I'll get that to you as soon as it's out.
Here's your pizza.
Be careful, it's right out of the oven and very hot.
Can I get you anything else?
Could I please have a refill?
Sure thing.
Can I get you anything else?
Just the check.
I'll be right back with it.
Alright, have a good night!
