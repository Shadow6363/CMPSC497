My girlfriend broke up with me.
Your girlfriend broke up with me?
I needed more attention.
What would it mean to you if you got more attention?
I wouldn't be sad.
I'm sorry to hear you're sad.
It's alright.
Why do you say that?
There's nothing I can do now.
Can you elaborate on why you think you're sad?
Everyone hates me.
Why do you say that?
Not even my mother talks to me.
Tell me more about your family.
