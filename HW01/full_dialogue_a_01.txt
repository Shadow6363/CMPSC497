Men are all alike.
In what way?
They're always bugging us about something or other.
Can you think of a specific example?
Well, my boyfriend made me come here.
Your boyfriend made you come here?
He says I'm depressed much of the time.
I'm sorry to hear you're depressed.
It's true, I am unhappy.
Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?
I need some help; that much seems certain.
What would it mean to you if you got some help?
Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.
Tell me more about your family.
My mother takes care of me.
Who else takes care of of you?
My father.
Your father?
You are like my father in some ways.
What resemblance do you see?
